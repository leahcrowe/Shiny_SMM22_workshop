## We don't have computer science training...

#### But we have figured it out with the help of these resources:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em"}
-   [RStudio resources](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

-   GitHub

-   Stackoverflow

-   Google

-   Workshops and webinars (e.g., [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html), [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/), etc.)

-   Other people!

    -   R user group at NEFSC, grad student group at Dal, Twitter (Tidy Tuesdays, R ladies, etc.)

## Foundation of all data analysis is good data management

::: incremental
-   Consistent data types and column names

    -   Date formatting

    -   QA/QC of sources of human error

-   Write code to encompass universal processes
:::

## Github and our workshop repo

::: incremental
-   Everyone should have a GitHub account by now

-   But what even is GitHub?

    -   Tracks changes, eases collaboration with others and your future self, organizes your work

        -   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world>

        -   <http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/github.html#setup-git-github>

## Discussion

-   What repeatable processes occur in your work?

-   Do you have time-sensitive materials to distribute to stakeholders?
